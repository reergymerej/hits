## Why?

@dwyl we have a _few_ projects on GitHub ... <br />

We want to _instantly see_ the _popularity_
of _each_ of our repos
to know what people are finding _useful_ and help us
decide where we need to be investing our time.

While GitHub has a _basic_
"[traffic](https://github.com/blog/1672-introducing-github-traffic-analytics)"
[tab](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/graphs/traffic)
which displays page view stats, GitHub only records the data
for the [_past 14 days_](https://github.com/dwyl/hits/issues/49)
and then it gets reset.
The data is not relayed to the "owner" in "***real time***"
and you would need to use the API and "poll" for data ...
_Manually_ checking who has viewed a
project is _exceptionally_ tedious when you have
more than a _handful_ of projects.

<!--
### Scratch Your Own Itch?

Some people claim that scratching your own itch is a "terrible idea" ...
Most of those people have never built anything.

We think Jessica Livingston (YCombinator Co-founder)
knows more about people successfully building ideas than _anyone_ else.

> "_**Solve** a **problem** that you **yourself have**
then you will at least know
that it's something that **at least one person really wants**.
And when you are **part** of the **target market** you will have **insights**
about it that you wouldn't otherwise._"
~ **Jessica Livingston** https://youtu.be/a2B4cVFIVpg?t=2m56s

Hits solves a problem for _us_ @dwyl
and we make the service available to others.
We are very much building a "scratcher" for our own itch,
and making it available to anyone else who wants it.

### Why Phoenix (Elixir + PostgreSQL/Ecto)?

We wrote our MVP in `Node.js`, see:
https://github.com/dwyl/hits-nodejs <br />
That worked quite well to test the idea while writing minimal code.

We decided to re-write in `Elixir`/`Phoenix` because we want
the reliability and fault tolerance of `Erlang`,
built-in application monitoring
([`supervisor`](http://erlang.org/doc/man/supervisor.html))
and metrics ([`telemetry`](https://github.com/beam-telemetry/telemetry))
and the built-in support for _highly_ scalable WebSockets
that will allow us to build an _awesome_ real-time UX!

For more on "Why Elixir?" see:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir/issues/102



## What?

A _simple & easy_ way to see how many people
have _viewed_ your GitHub Repository.

There are already *many* "badges" that people use in their repos.
See: [github.com/dwyl/**repo-badges**](https://github.com/dwyl/repo-badges) <br />
But we haven't seen one that gives a "***hit counter***"
of the number of times a GitHub page has been viewed ... <br />
So, in today's mini project we're going to _create_ a _basic **Web Counter**_.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_counter

#### A Fully Working Production Phoenix App _And_ Step-by-Step Tutorial?

Yes, that's right!
Not only is this a fully functioning web app
that is serving _millions_ of requests per day
in production _right_ now,
it's also a step-by-step example/tutorial
showing you _exactly_
how it's implemented.


## How?

> If you simply want to display a "hit count badge"
in your project's GitHub page, visit:
http://hits.dwyl.io
to get the Markdown!



### _Run_ the App on `localhost`

To _run_ the app on your localhost follow these easy steps:

#### 0. Ensure your `localhost` has Node.js & Phoenix installed

see: [before you start](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#0-pre-requisites-before-you-start)


#### 1. Clone/Download the Code

```
git clone https://github.com/dwyl/hits.git && cd hits
```

#### 2. Install the Dependencies

Install elixir/node dependencies
and setup Webpack static asset compilation (_with hot reloading_):

```
mix deps.get
cd assets && npm install
node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development && cd ..
```

#### 3. Create the database

```
mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate
```

### 4. Run the App

```
mix phx.server
```

That's it! <br />


Visit: http://localhost:4000/ (_in your web browser_)

![hits-homepage-phoenix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57912373-0b2b9d00-7882-11e9-8dfd-df1021e9d076.png)


Or visit _any_ endpoint that includes `.svg` in the url,
e.g: http://localhost:4000/yourname/project.svg

![hits-example-badge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57980413-57faa980-7a23-11e9-91cd-cc9e106be1ee.png)

Refresh the page a few times and watch the count go up!

![hit-count-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57980416-62b53e80-7a23-11e9-948a-7c423ecb18c1.png)

> note: the "Zoom" in chrome to 500% for _effect_.


Now, take your time to peruse the code in `/test` and `/lib`,
and _ask_ any questions by opening GitHub Issues:
https://github.com/dwyl/hits/issues


### Run the Tests

To run the tests on your localhost,
execute the following command in your terminal:

```elixir
mix test
```

To run the tests with coverage,
run the following command
in your terminal:

```elixir
MIX_ENV=test mix cover
```

If you want to view the coverage in a web browser:

```elixir
mix coveralls.html && open cover/excoveralls.html
```

<br /> <br />


# _Implementation_

This is a step-by-step guide
to _building_ the Hits App
from scratch
in Phoenix.


### Assumptions / Prerequisites

+ [x] `Elixir` & `Phoenix` installed.
see: [**_before_ you start**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example#0-pre-requisites-before-you-start)
+ [x] Basic knowledge/understanding of `Elixir` syntax:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#how
+ [x] Basic understanding of `Phoenix`:
https://github.com/dwyl/learn-phoenix-framework
+ [x] Basic PostgreSQL knowledge:
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-postgresql**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-postgresql)
+ [x] Test Driven Development (TDD):
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-tdd**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tdd)

## Create New Phoenix App


```sh
mix phx.new hits
```
When prompted to install the dependencies:
```sh
Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn]
```
Type `Y` and the `Enter` key to install.

You should see something like this in your terminal:
```sh
* running mix deps.get
* running cd assets && npm install && node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --mode development
* running mix deps.compile

We are almost there! The following steps are missing:

    $ cd hits

Then configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

    $ mix ecto.create

Start your Phoenix app with:

    $ mix phx.server

You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:

    $ iex -S mix phx.server
```

Follow the instructions (run the following commands)
to create the PostgreSQL database for the app:

```sh
cd hits
mix ecto.create
```

You should see the following in your terminal:

```sh
Compiling 13 files (.ex)
Generated hits app
The database for Hits.Repo has already been created
```

Run the default tests to confirm everything is working:

```sh
mix test
```
You should see the following output
```sh
Generated hits app
...

Finished in 0.03 seconds
3 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 98214
```


Start the Phoenix server:
```sh
mix phx.server
```

That spits out a bunch of data about Webpack compilation:
```sh
[info] Running HitsWeb.Endpoint with cowboy 2.6.3 at 0.0.0.0:4000 (http)
[info] Access HitsWeb.Endpoint at http://localhost:4000

Webpack is watching the filesâ€¦

Visit the app in your web browser to confirm it's all working:
http://localhost:4000
![phoenix-app-default-homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57190794-71293380-6f16-11e9-8df3-1fb87139e6a3.png)

The default Phoenix App home page
should be familiar to you
if you followed our Chat example/tutorial
[github.com/dwyl/**phoenix-chat-example**](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example)


## Create the _Static_ Home Page

In order to help people understand what Hits is
and how they can add a counter badge to their project,
we have a simple (_static_) home page.
In the interest of doing a "feature parity" migration
from the Node.js MVP to the Phoenix version,
we are just copying over the
[`index.html`](https://github.com/dwyl/hits/blob/0a44edd692b5b765c20c85ed4057a50bbd872507/lib/index.html)
at this stage; we can/will enhance it later.

Phoenix has the concept of a Layout template
which allows us to put all layout related
code in a single file and
then each subsequent page of content
does not have to worry about static (CSS/JS) assets
and metadata.
Open the file
`/lib/hits_web/templates/layout/app.html.eex`
in your text editor. It should look like this:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <title>Hits Â· Phoenix Framework</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/css/app.css") %>"/>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <section class="container">
        <nav role="navigation">
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/overview.html">Get Started</a></li>
          </ul>
        </nav>
        <a href="http://phoenixframework.org/" class="phx-logo">
          <img src="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/images/phoenix.png") %>" alt="Phoenix Framework Logo"/>
        </a>
      </section>
    </header>
    <main role="main" class="container">
      <p class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><%= get_flash(@conn, :info) %></p>
      <p class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><%= get_flash(@conn, :error) %></p>
      <%= render @view_module, @view_template, assigns %>
    </main>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/js/app.js") %>"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's remove the cruft and keep only the essential layout html:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <title>Hits</title>
    <!-- <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/css/app.css") %>"/> -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/tachyons@4.8.0/css/tachyons.min.css"/>
  </head>
  <body class="">
    <main role="main"">

      <%= render @view_module, @view_template, assigns %>
    </main>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="<%= Routes.static_path(@conn, "/js/app.js") %>"></script>
    <style> /* custom classes for specific @dwyl color scheme */
      .teal {
        color: #4DB6AC;
      }
      .bg-teal {
        background: #4DB6AC;
      }
      body { /* dwyl font */
        font-family: "Open Sans", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
      }
    </style>
  </body>
</html>
```
We removed the link to `app.css`
and a couple of elements
as we don't need them;
we can always add them back later,
that's the beauty of version control,
nothing is ever "lost".

If you refresh the page you should see the following:
![phoenix-homepage-no-style](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57190961-4cce5680-6f18-11e9-8542-582c9120196f.png)

Don't panic, this is _expected_!
We just removed `app.css` in the layout template
and Phoenix does not have/use any Tachyons classes
so no styling is present.
We'll fix it in the next step.

Open the homepage template file in your editor:
`lib/hits_web/templates/page/index.html.eex`

You should see something like this:
```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1><%= gettext "Welcome to %{name}!", name: "Phoenix" %></h1>
  <p>A productive web framework that<br/>does not compromise speed or maintainability.</p>
</section>

<section class="row">

</section>
```

Notice how the page template only has the HTML code
relevant to rendering _this_ page. <br />
Let's replace the code in the file
with the markup relevant to the Hits homepage:

```html
<h2 class="bg-teal white h-25 tc ttu f1 lh-title lh-solid mt0 pa2 pb3 mb0 pb0">

  </table>
</div>

<div class="h5 pl2" id='hits'>
  <div style="display:none">Dummy Child Node for insertBefore to work</div>
</div>
```

> _**Note**: we are using Tachyons (Functional) CSS
for styling the page,
if you haven't yet learned about Tachyons,
we recommend reading_:
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-tachyons**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tachyons)

This is a fairly simple homepage.
The only _interesting_ part are the Tachyons styles
which are fairly straightforward.

Finally we need to update
`assets/js/app.js`
to add the code to render a badge
when people input their `username` and `repo` name.

Open the `assets/js/app.js` which should look like this:

```js
// We need to import the CSS so that webpack will load it.
// The MiniCssExtractPlugin is used to separate it out into
// its own CSS file.
import css from "../css/app.css"

// webpack automatically bundles all modules in your
// entry points. Those entry points can be configured
// in "webpack.config.js".
//
// Import dependencies
//
import "phoenix_html"

// Import local files
//
// Local files can be imported directly using relative paths, for example:
// import socket from "./socket"
```

Add the following lines to the end:
```js
// Markdown Template
var mt = document.getElementById('badge').innerHTML;

function generate_markdown () {
  var user = document.getElementById("username").value || '{username}';
  var repo = document.getElementById("repo").value || '{project}';
  // console.log('user: ', user, 'repo: ', repo);
  user = user.replace(/[.*+?^$<>()|[\]\\]/g, ''); // trim and escape
  repo = repo.replace(/[.*+?^$<>()|[\]\\]/g, '');
  return mt.replace(/{username}/g, user).replace(/{repo}/g, repo);
}

function display_badge_markdown () {
  var md = generate_markdown()
  var pre = document.getElementById("badge").innerHTML = md;
}

setTimeout(function () {
  // show form if JS available (progressive enhancement)
  document.getElementById("how").classList.remove('dn');
  document.getElementById("nojs").classList.add('dn');
  display_badge_markdown(); // render initial markdown template
  var get = document.getElementsByTagName('input');
 for (var i = 0; i < get.length; i++) {
     get[i].addEventListener('keyup', display_badge_markdown, false);
     get[i].addEventListener('keyup', display_badge_markdown, false);
 }
}, 500);
```

Run the Phoenix server to see the static page:
```
mix phx.server
```
Now visit the route in your web browser:
http://localhost:4000

![hits-static-homepage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57684208-3ff2e680-762d-11e9-89c4-0b0d04694f5a.png)

Now that the static homepage is working,
we can move on to the _interesting_ part of the Hits Application!

> As always, if you have questions or got stuck at any point,
please open an issue and we will help!
https://github.com/dwyl/hits/issues

### _Fix_ The Failing Test

Before moving on to building the app,
let's make sure that the default tests are passing ...

```
mix test
```
![failing-test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57686427-7f233680-7631-11e9-83ef-931016d7b68b.png)

The reason for this failing test is pretty clear,
the page no longer contains the words "Welcome to Phoenix!".

Open the file `test/hits_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs`
and update the assertion text.

From:

```elixir
test "GET /", %{conn: conn} do
  conn = get(conn, "/")
  assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Welcome to Phoenix!"
end
```

To:

```elixir
test "GET /", %{conn: conn} do
  conn = get(conn, "/")
  assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Hits!"
end
```

Re-run the test:

```sh
mix test
```

![hits-static-page-test-passing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57686862-46d02800-7632-11e9-8be0-76e46c4d1cd9.png)

The test should now pass
and we can crack on with creating the schemas!


## Create The Database for Storing Data

As is typical of most Phoenix applications,
we will be using a PostgreSQL database for storing data.

In your terminal, run the create script:

```sh
mix ecto.create
```
In your terminal you should see:

```sh
Compiling 2 files (.ex)
The database for Hits.Repo has been created
```
This tells you the PostgreSQL database **`hits_dev`** was successfully created.

### Note on Database Normalization

In designing the Hits App database,
we decided to normalize
the database tables for efficient storage
because we wanted to make the storage of an individual hit
as minimal as possible.
This means we have 4 schemas/tables to ensure there is no duplicate data
and each bit of data is only stored _once_.
We could have stored all the data in a _single_ table
and on the surface this is appealing
because it would only require one insert
query and no "joins" when selecting/counting hits.
But the initial benefit of a single table
would be considerably outweighed
by the wasted space of duplicate data.

This is not the time or place
to dive into the merits
of database normalization and denormalisation.
We will have a chance to explore it later
when we need to optimise query performance.
For now we are focussing on building the App
with a database normalized to the third normal form (3NF)
because it achieves a good balance of
eliminating data duplication thus maximising storage efficiency
while still having adequate query performance.

You won't need to understand any of these concepts
to follow along with building the Hits app.
But if you are curious about any of these words, read the following pages:
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormalization
+ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_normal_form

### Create the 4 Schemas

+ users - for simplicity sake we are assuming that
all repositories belong to a "user" and not an organisation.
+ repositories - the projects on GitHub
+ useragents - the web browsers viewing the project pages
+ hits - the record of each "hit" (page view).

```sh
mix phx.gen.schema User users name:string
mix phx.gen.schema Repository repositories name:string user_id:references:users
mix phx.gen.schema Useragent useragents name:string ip:string
mix phx.gen.schema Hit hits repo_id:references:repositories useragent_id:references:useragents
```
In your terminal,
you will see a suggestion in the terminal output similar to this:


Before we can run the database migration, we must create the database.

Now we can run the scripts to create the database tables:
```
mix ecto.migrate
```

In your terminal, you should see:

```sh
Compiling 17 files (.ex)
Generated hits app
[info] == Running 20190515211749 Hits.Repo.Migrations.CreateUsers.change/0 forward

[info] create index hits_repo_id_index
[info] create index hits_useragent_id_index
[info] == Migrated 20190515211819 in 0.0s
```
> _**Note**: the dates of your migration files will differ from these.
The 14 digit number corresponds to the date and time
in the format **`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`**.
This is helpful for knowing when the database schemas/fields
were created or updated._

#### View the Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

Now that the Postgres database tables have been created,
you can fire up your database client
(_e.g: DBeaver in this case_)
and view the Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram:

![hits-er-diagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57219989-b1a9af80-6ff1-11e9-8968-e3b76428093d.png)

This us shows us the four tables we created above
and how they are related (_with foreign keys_).
It also shows us that there is `schema_migrations` table,
which is _unrelated_ to the tables we created for our app,
but contains the log of the schema migrations that have been run
and when they were applied to the database:

![hits-schema-migrations](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57811257-b55fd380-7761-11e9-9ad3-cf06757a410b.png)

The keen observer will note that the migration table data:
```sh
version       |inserted_at        |
--------------|-------------------|
20190515211749|2019-05-15 21:18:38|
20190515211755|2019-05-15 21:18:38|
20190515211804|2019-05-15 21:18:38|
20190515211819|2019-05-15 21:18:38|
```
The version column corresponds to the date timestamps
in the migration file names:

priv/repo/migrations/**20190515211749**_create_users.exs <br />
priv/repo/migrations/**20190515211755**_create_repositories.exs <br />
priv/repo/migrations/**20190515211804**_create_useragents.exs <br />
priv/repo/migrations/**20190515211819**_create_hits.exs <br />


### _Run_ the Tests

Once you have created the schemas and run the resulting migrations,
it's time to run the tests!

```sh
mix test
```

Everything should still pass because `phx.gen.schema`
does not create any new tests
and our previous tests are unaffected.

### SVG Badge Template

We created the SVG badge template for our MVP
[`template.svg`](https://github.com/dwyl/hits-nodejs/blob/master/lib/template.svg)
and it still serves our needs
so there's no need to change it.

Create a new file `lib/hits_web/templates/hit/badge.svg`
and paste the following SVG code in it:

```svg
<?xml version="1.0"?> <!-- SVG container is 80 x 20 pixel rectangle -->
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="80" height="20">
	<rect width="30" height="20" fill="#555"/> <!-- grey rectangle 30px width -->
	<rect x="30" width="50" height="20" fill="#4c1"/> <!-- green rect 30px -->
	<g fill="#fff" text-anchor="middle" font-size="11"
    font-family="DejaVu Sans,Verdana,Geneva,sans-serif">   <!-- group & font -->
	    <text x="15" y="14">hits</text>                      <!-- "hits" label -->
	    <text x="54" y="14">{count}</text>  <!-- count is replaced with number -->
	</g>
</svg> <!-- that's it! pretty simple, right? :-) Any questions? Ask! -->
```
The comments are there for beginner-friendliness,
they are stripped out before sending the badge to the client
to conserve bandwidth.

### Create a _Failing_ Test

Let's start by addressing the _first_ failing test:

![first-failing-test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/57181253-35945800-6e89-11e9-8fa5-f829e3d03090.png)


Run the following command to execute the _single_ test starting on line 36
```sh
mix test test/hits_web/controllers/hit_controller_test.exs:36
```
Open `test/hits_web/controllers/hit_controller_test.exs` in your editor.

## Add Channel

If you are new to Phoenix Channels, please recap:
https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-chat-example

In your terminal, run the following command:
```sh
mix phx.gen.channel Hit
```
You should see the following output:

```
* creating lib/hits_web/channels/hit_channel.ex
* creating test/hits_web/channels/hit_channel_test.exs

Add the channel to your `lib/hits_web/channels/user_socket.ex` handler, for example:

    channel "hit:lobby", HitsWeb.HitChannel
```

> If you want to see the code required
to render the hits on the homepage in realtime,
please see: https://github.com/dwyl/hits/pull/80/files
